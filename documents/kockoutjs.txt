For a project I'm working on, I wrote a simple ko.unapplyBindings function that accepts
a jQuery node and the remove boolean. It first unbinds all jQuery events as ko.cleanNode
method doesn't take care of that. I've tested for memory leaks, and it appears to work
just fine.

ko.unapplyBindings = function ($node, remove) {
    // unbind events
    $node.find("*").each(function () {
        $(this).unbind();
    });

    // Remove KO subscriptions and references
    if (remove) {
        ko.removeNode($node[0]);
    } else {
        ko.cleanNode($node[0]);
    }
};
